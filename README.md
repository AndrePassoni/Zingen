## 🚀 Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
- **CSS3**: Styling with advanced concepts such as:
  - Flexbox & Grid Layout;
  - CSS Variables (Custom Properties);
  - Media Queries for Responsiveness;
  - Relative units (rem, em, %);
  - Transitions and hover effects.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control.

## 💻 Project

**Zingen** is a modern, responsive landing page designed for a fictional Karaoke app. The page highlights the app's main features, such as AI vocal removal, real-time lyrics synchronization, and performance scoring.

The main goal of this project was to practice layout construction, responsiveness (Mobile First approach), and clean code practices using pure CSS without external frameworks.

## 🔖 Layout

The page consists of the following sections:

1.  **Header**: Navigation menu and logo.
2.  **Hero Section**: Main value proposition with call-to-action buttons.
3.  **App Showcase**: Visual representation of the app on smartphones.
4.  **About**: Explanation of the AI technology.
5.  **Features**: A grid layout displaying key functionalities (Gamification, Recording, Community).
6.  **Pricing**: Subscription plans cards (Basic, Premium, Family).
7.  **Download**: Final CTA to download the app.
8.  **Footer**: Links and social media icons.
